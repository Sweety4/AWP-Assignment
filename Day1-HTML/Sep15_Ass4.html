    <h3 id="oopconcept">OOP Concept</h3>
    <p>
        Object Oriented programming is a programming style
        <br />
        that is associated with the concept of Class,objects
        <br />
        and various other concepts revolving around these two,
        <br />
        like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation etc.
    </p>

    <h3 id="rtti">RTTI</h3>
    <p>
        In this section, we will see what is the RTTI (Runtime Type Information) in C++.
        <br />
        In C++ the RTTI is a mechanism, that exposes information about an object’s datatype
        <br />
        during runtime. This feature can be available only when the class has at least one
        <br />
        virtual function. It allows the type of an object to be determined when the program
        <br />
        is executing.
    </p>

    <h3 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h3>
    <p>
        Namespace is a container for identifiers. It puts the names
        <br />
        of its members in a distinct space so that they don't conflict
        <br />
        with the names in other namespaces or global namespace.

    </p>

    <h3 id="exception">Exception Handling</h3>
    <p>
        One of the advantages of C++ over C is Exception Handling.
        <br />
        Exceptions are run-time anomalies or abnormal conditions
        <br />
        that a program encounters during its execution.
        <br />
        There are two types of exceptions: a)Synchronous,
        <br />
        b)Asynchronous(Ex:which are beyond the program’s control, Disc failure etc).
