    <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
    <p>
        One of the advantages of C++ over C is Exception Handling.
        <br />
        Exceptions are run-time anomalies or abnormal conditions
        <br />
        that a program encounters during its execution.
        <br />
        There are two types of exceptions: a)Synchronous,
        <br />
        b)Asynchronous(Ex:which are beyond the program’s control, Disc failure etc).
