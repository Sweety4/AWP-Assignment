    <h3>RTTI</h3>
    <p>
        In this section, we will see what is the RTTI (Runtime Type Information) in C++.
        <br />
        In C++ the RTTI is a mechanism, that exposes information about an object’s datatype
        <br />
        during runtime. This feature can be available only when the class has at least one
        <br />
        virtual function. It allows the type of an object to be determined when the program
        <br />
        is executing.
