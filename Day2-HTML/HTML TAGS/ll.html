    <h2>Linked List</h2>
    <p>
        A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are
        not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked
        list are linked using pointers.
        In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node
        contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
