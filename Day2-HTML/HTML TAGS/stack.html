    <h2>Stack</h2>
    <p>
        Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order
        in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In
        First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
        There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of
        plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at 
        the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been 
        placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest 
        period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First
        Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.
