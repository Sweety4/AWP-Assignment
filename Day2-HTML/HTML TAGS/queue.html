    <h2>Queue</h2>
    <p>
        A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in
        which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out
        (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a
        resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The
        difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we
        remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the
        item the least recently added.
