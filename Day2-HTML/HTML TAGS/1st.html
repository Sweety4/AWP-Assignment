    <h2 style="text-align:center">Stack</h2>
    <p id="stack">
        <b>Stack</b> is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in
        which the operations are performed. <span style="color:red">The order may
        be LIFO(Last In First Out)or FILO(First In Last Out).</span>
        There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates
        stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the
        first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost
        position remains in the <i>stack for the longest period of time</i>. So, it can be simply
        seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center">Queue</h2>
    <p id="queue">
        A <b>Queue</b> is a <i>linear structure</i> which follows a particular order in which the
        operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example 
        of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came 
        first is served first. <span style=" background-color:yellow"> The difference between stacks
        and queues is in removing. </span> In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; 
        in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
        </p>
    
    <h2 style="text-align:center">Linked List</h2>
    <p id="ll">
        A <b>linked list</b> is a <i>linear data structure,</i> in which the elements are not stored
        at <u>contiguous memory locations.</u> The elements in a linked list are linked using
        pointers.
           <span style="background-color:green">In simple words, a linked list consists</span> of nodes 
        where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
